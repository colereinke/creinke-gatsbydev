### What is Hands on Oshkosh?

Hands on Oshkosh is a program where students, faculty and staff come together to go out into the community to volunteer and make a difference. Volunteer projects during the day vary based on what agencies are partnered with.

### What did I do?

In the past registration for Hands on Oshkosh has been done through a Google Form. Students would have to visit our website where they would be linked to the form creating a poor user experience. I created a new registration form on our website and styled it to tie in with the poster to create a more cohesive brand. In additon I designed an email to be sent to the student after the registered.
