### What is Ozzi?

Ozzi is a reusable container system/machine that's utilized at UW Oshkosh. Students just need to request the Ozzi To-Go Container at select campus dining locations. 

### What did I do?

I was responsible for creating the various marketing pieces for Ozzi. The goal was to create awareness about the containers along with educating people on how to utilize the containers. I designed the poster to create a earthy feel with the wood to relate to sustainability and used photos of food from the various locations it's available. A poster, Campus Vision slide, table tent and napkin holders.
